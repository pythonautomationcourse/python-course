You must be make a program that determines if a word is a Palindrome or not.

Algorithm

1. You must be save a string into a variable.
2. This variable must be broken down into a list.
3. It's necessary changes the order element's list
4. After having the list it is necessary to change the order of the elements
from the list of "left to right" to "right to left". Must be able to reverse
the order, for example:
    Element 0 must be the last in the list
    Element 1 must be the penultimate element.

5. Save this data in a variable.
6. If variable 1 is equal to variable 2.
      The word is a palindrome.
Else.
      The word is not a palindrome.
